    "Ridge regression is a linear regression technique used for predictive modeling and statistical analysis. It is an extension of ordinary \n",

    "However, when there are multiple predictors that are highly correlated, OLS can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",

    "Ridge regression addresses this issue by adding a regularization term, known as the L2 penalty, to the OLS cost function. The L2 penalty is the\n",
