    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions to ensure accurate and reliable results. Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear. This means that the regression \n",
    "model assumes a straight-line relationship between the predictors and the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of errors: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. There should be no systematic patterns or correlations\n",
    "in the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the predictors. In other words, the spread of the residuals\n",
    "should be similar for different values of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of errors: The errors should follow a normal distribution. This assumption allows for valid hypothesis testing and confidence interval\n",
    "estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "No multicollinearity: The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can lead to unstable and\n",
    "unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can perform the following diagnostic checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plots: Visualize the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable using scatter plots. Look for any obvious\n",
    "non-linear patterns or deviations from linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual plots: Plot the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variables. Check for any patterns, such as a curved relationship\n",
    "or funnel shape, which may indicate violations of assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality tests: Perform statistical tests, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Anderson-Darling test, to assess the normality of the residuals.\n",
    "Alternatively, you can create a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals to visually inspect their distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity tests: Use statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan test or the White test to examine the homoscedasticity assumption. \n",
    "Another approach is to plot the residuals against the predicted values and look for a consistent spread across the range of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation matrix: Calculate the correlation coefficients between the independent variables. If there is a high correlation \n",
    "(e.g., correlation coefficient close to 1 or -1) between predictors, it suggests the presence of multicollinearity."

    "Interpretation: For every one-unit increase in the independent variable, the expected change in the dependent variable is β₁, assuming all\n",

    "\n",
