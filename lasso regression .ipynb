    "Lasso Regression, short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator,\" is a regression technique that combines \n",
    "regularization and variable selection. It is similar to Ridge Regression but differs in the type of regularization and its impact \n",
    "on the coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key characteristics and differences of Lasso Regression compared to other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Lasso Regression adds a regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) cost function. However, \n",
    "unlike Ridge Regression that uses the L2 norm of the coefficients for regularization, Lasso Regression uses the L1 norm.\n",
    "The L1 regularization term in Lasso Regression encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates by driving some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "This property makes Lasso Regression capable of performing both regularization and feature selection simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: One of the main advantages of Lasso Regression is its ability to automatically select relevant features by setting\n",
    "their coefficients to zero. This feature selection property arises due to the L1 regularization. When the regularization parameter (lambda) is\n",
    "appropriately chosen, Lasso Regression can identify and exclude irrelevant or less important predictors from the model, leading to a more\n",
    "interpretable and efficient model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shrinkage: Like Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression also shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. However, due to the L1 regularization,\n",
    "Lasso Regression has a more pronounced shrinkage effect compared to Ridge Regression. This means that Lasso Regression tends to yield more \n",

    "L1 regularization term in Lasso Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key advantages of using Lasso Regression for feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic feature selection: Lasso Regression has the capability to perform automatic feature selection by setting the \n",
    "coefficients of irrelevant or less important predictors to zero. This means that Lasso Regression can determine which predictors \n",
    "are the most relevant for predicting the response variable without requiring explicit input or domain knowledge about the \n",
    "importance of predictors. The resulting model contains only the selected features, leading to a more interpretable and efficient model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse models: Lasso Regression tends to produce sparse models, where only a subset of the predictors has non-zero coefficients. \n",
    "This sparsity property can be advantageous when dealing with high-dimensional data, where the number of predictors is large compared\n",
    "to the number of observations. By selecting a subset of predictors, Lasso Regression reduces the complexity of the model and \n",
    "mitigates the risk of overfitting, improving generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved interpretability: With its feature selection capability, Lasso Regression provides a more interpretable model. The selected features \n",
    "with non-zero coefficients in the Lasso Regression model are directly associated with the response variable, allowing for a clearer understanding\n",
    "of the variables that are most influential in predicting the outcome. This can be particularly valuable in domains where interpretability \n",
    "is crucial, such as medicine, finance, or social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles multicollinearity: Lasso Regression can effectively handle multicollinearity among predictor variables. When predictors are highly \n",
    "correlated, Lasso Regression tends to select one variable from the correlated set and set the coefficients of the others to zero.\n",
    "This can help identify the most representative variable from a group of highly correlated predictors and eliminate redundant information \n",

    "\n",
    "Magnitude: The magnitude of the coefficient represents the strength of the relationship between the corresponding predictor variable\n",
